# Continuon Developer Assignment
 
# Brief
This test has been designed to test the fundamentals required to work at Continuon. The brief is relatively straight forward - build a small lightweight web app making use of the google search API. It will however be preferred if you use any of the following frameworks: PHP(Laravel/Lumen) / Python(Flask/Django) to complete this assignment.

# We will test for the following:

1. Ability to work with version control
2. Understanding of PHP/Python
3. Ability to work with APIs
4. Ability to solve logic problems
5. Database Architecture

# 1. Create a Github or Bitbucket repository

The test will be considered complete when you send a link to your repo.

# 2. Build web app as per brief

You can look at this for reference: https://trends.google.com/trends/. In the end if we search for a topic via your web app ie: Star Wars we would like to see the interest over time and the interest by region(the bar chart) being pulled from the api. No need for all the extra functionality(export/login/register), we just want the visual representation of api data in an efficient manner.

Lastly, if you can please provide a portion of the data stored in a database(mySQL). This is to support the idea to optimally store a large amount of data.

# 3. Suggest an improvement to the test

We believe in collective knowledge. Suggest a way (any constructive way) that can improve this test.
Work at Continuon
We obviously supply things like coffee and beer. However, what we are is a team of people that love technology and learning.
